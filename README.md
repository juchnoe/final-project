# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
For my final project, I thought of doing a text based adventure game. I would look into incorporating something perhaps like the rolling of dice to have effects on particular situations, outcomes, or abilities throughout the story. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
I will be working by myself.

## Do you have any questions of your own?
I don't believe I have any at the moment.
