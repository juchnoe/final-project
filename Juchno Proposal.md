# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will be a text based choose your own adventure game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I plan to do a text based choose your own adventure game that utilizes the rolling of dice as a form of randomization to impact the player's choices in the game. As the player progresses through their options and chooses their desired paths, the results they roll will effect particular outcomes and events, influencing the additional choices they may or may not make playing through. For certain sections, the use of turtles would come into play to illustrate certain parts or situations. I would also like to include a menu system to make the input from the player to be easy and straightforward, perhaps through the use of a GUI if I can reach that point.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

This will not be combined with another course's final project.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I plan to work by myself.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

What I intend to accomplish regardless, is to have a system of choices, where the user can select their choices from a text menu that pops up whenever they need to provide an input or select an option. On dice rolls, the results will determine their chances with particular outcomes, having different circumstances occurring based off the number. This may also affect their choices following particular rolls.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I plan to have the layout of choices and outcomes be clean and cohesive throughout the game, allowing the player to progress through without error. I also may include the use of turtles at portions to illustrate particular situations or outcomes that occur to add a minor visual element.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

One thing I hope I may be able to achieve, is to perhaps include a visual GUI of some sort, to go beyond plain text inputs and outputs. This would be through the use of some external software, though I would have to learn how to make that work. If I end up reaching this point quick enough, I may even look into adding some more graphical elements to the game through a basic engine of some sort. I am certainly no expert with this, though based off of the progress I make, it would be something fitting to try to implement. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will first need to map out a story with a variety of options, events, situations, etc. I will need to implement a system of menus to allow for easy input for each choice the player makes. I will use my learned knowledge of using randomization and functions to add the dice element. As far as researching new skills, I may see if thereâ€™s anything interesting beyond my knowledge that I can implement with turtles to make things more appealing. If I am able to reach the point of figuring out the addition of a GUI or even beyond to something more polished, I will need to teach myself how to effectively work my creation into a more visually appealing presentation for the user.
