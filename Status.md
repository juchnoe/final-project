Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I have set up a text based menu selection, a variety of choices and paths for the user to pick, as well as implementation the use of randomization with dice rolling for particular events.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have only added a little use of turtles so far and am thinking of good ways to use that idea further to enhance the game. I also need to properly tie parts of the story together and lead it to a completion.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have not encountered anything that I couldn't figure out with enough thought and time, mostly figuring out the best way to set up the code.
